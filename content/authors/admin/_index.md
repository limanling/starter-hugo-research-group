ðŸ‘‹ Hi, there! I'm **Manling**. I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), working with Prof. [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) as a member of the [Blender NLP lab](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/index.html). 
At the core of my research in **Multimodal Information Extraction**, I aim to equip machines with **deep semantic understandings of multimodal information**, providing a structured knowledge view that is easily explainable, highly compositional, and capable of reasoning.
<!-- Prior to UIUC, I got my master's degree from [Institute of Computing Technology](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.cas.cn/) in 2018, and received my bachelor's degree from [University of Science and Technology Beijing](http://www.ustb.edu.cn/index.asp) with Beijing Outstanding Undergraduate Award in 2015. -->
<!-- Her research probes the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV). She aims to turn text and vision information access **from entity-centric to event-centric**, providing a structured knowledge view that is easily explainable, highly compositional, and capable of reasoning. -->
<!-- What happens? Who? When? Where? Why?* are the fundamental questions asked to comprehend the overwhelming amount of information, regardless of whether presented as text, images, or videos. I propose to evolve traditional Entity-Centric Single-Modalitiy Knowledge to **Event-Centric Multi-Modality Knowledge**.  -->
<!-- My research aims to equip machines with **deep semantic understandings of multimodal information**. 
*What happens? Who? When? Where? Why?* are the fundamental questions asked to comprehend the overwhelming amount of information, regardless of whether presented as text, images, or videos. 
I aim to evolve traditional Entity-Centric Single-Modalitiy Knowledge to **Event-Centric Multi-Modality Knowledge**, including: 
<br>
(1) understanding **multimodal event semantic structures** to answer *What happened?, Who?, Where?, and When?* (Knowledge Extraction):  We bring event argument (participant) semantics into vision-language pretraining (CLIP-Event), which has supported zero-shot joint Multimedia Event Extraction (M<sup>2</sup>E<sup>2</sup> for the first time;
<br> 
(2) understanding **temporal dynamics** to answer *What will happen next? and Why?* (Knowledge Reasoning): We introduce Event Graph Schema, which opens doors to a global event graph context capturing participant-specific and temporally ordered event information; 
<br>
(3) **applying Event Knowledge Graph** (Knowledge-Driven Applications): We show positive results on long-standing open problems, such as timeline generation, meeting summarization, question answering. -->

**Bio:**
Her work on multimodal knowledge extraction won the **ACL'20 Best Demo Paper Award**, and the work on scientific information extraction from COVID literature won **NAACL'21 Best Demo Paper Award**. She was a recipient of **Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship** in 2021. She was selected as a **DARPA Riser** in 2022 (nominated by DARPA), and a **EE CS Rising Star** in 2022. She was awarded C.L. Dave and Jane W.S. Liu Award, and has been selected as a Mavis Future Faculty Fellow. **She led 19 students to develop the UIUC information extraction system and ranked 1st in DARPA AIDA evaluation each phase**. She has more than 30 publications on multimodal knowledge extraction and reasoning, and gave tutorials about event-centric multimodal knowledge at ACL'21, AAAI'21, NAACL'22, AAAI'23, etc. 
<!-- She serves as a senior PC member at IJCAI and PC members for ARR, ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, COLING, IJCAI, AAAI, etc.  -->
